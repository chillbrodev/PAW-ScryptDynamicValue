## About Scrypt

[Scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) In cryptography, scrypt is a password-based key derivation function created by Colin Percival, originally for the Tarsnap online backup service. The algorithm was specifically designed to make it costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks by requiring large amounts of memory.
